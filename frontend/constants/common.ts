## Course Structure

This course is divided into four modules, each covering a specific aspect of quantum computing:

### Module 1: Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals

In this module, we'll lay the groundwork by exploring the essential concepts of quantum mechanics that are crucial for understanding quantum computing.

*   **Superposition and Qubits:** Learn about the concept of superposition, where a qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and how it differs from classical bits.
*   **Entanglement:** Explore the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where two or more qubits become correlated in such a way that they share the same fate, no matter how far apart they are.
*   **Quiz: Quantum Mechanics Basics:** Test your understanding of the fundamental concepts covered in this module.

### Module 2: Quantum Gates and Circuits

This module will introduce you to the building blocks of quantum computation: quantum gates and circuits.

*   **Single-Qubit Gates:** Learn about the Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, and Hadamard gates, and how they manipulate single qubits.
*   **Multi-Qubit Gates:** Understand CNOT and other multi-qubit gates, which are essential for creating entanglement and performing complex quantum operations.
*   **Quiz: Quantum Gates:** Test your knowledge of quantum gates and their functionalities.

### Module 3: Quantum Algorithms

In this module, we'll explore some of the most famous quantum algorithms and see how they can solve problems faster than classical algorithms.

*   **Deutsch's Algorithm:** Discover a simple algorithm that demonstrates the potential for quantum speedup.
*   **Grover's Algorithm:** Learn about Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm that can find a specific item in an unsorted database more efficiently than classical algorithms.
*   **Quiz: Quantum Algorithms:** Test your understanding of the quantum algorithms covered in this module.

### Module 4: Quantum Computing Platforms

This module will provide an overview of the different physical platforms that are being used to build quantum computers.

*   **Superconducting Qubits:** Introduction to superconducting qubits, which are based on superconducting circuits and are one of the leading platforms for quantum computing.
*   **Trapped Ions:** Introduction to trapped ion qubits, which use individual ions trapped in electromagnetic fields to represent qubits.
